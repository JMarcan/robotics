To calculate min and max in unsorted array of integers and optimize its run time,
my algorithm keeps two variables min a max. Then it loops one by one through array, compares each item with values in min and max variables and updates them accordingly.

Time complexity: O(n) as we loop throuh each element
Space Complexity O(1)
where n is number of integers in the provided array
